    <string name="descriptionText">By default, a Binding class will be generated based on the name of the layout file, converting it to Pascal case and suffixing “Binding” to it. The above layout file was activity_main.xml so the generate class was ActivityMainBinding

If your xml name is main_activity.xml than DataBinding class name will be MainActivityBinding.

Take note that data binding is enabled in the build.gradle file.
The tutorial will be updated to mention this explicitly.</string>
